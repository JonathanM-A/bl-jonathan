Theory
Git is a version control system or source control management which allows you to
keep track of changes to a file or coding project and who made those changes.
It is important becasue it allows you to rest your work to a previous version if 
changes made to the project are no longer wanted. It does this by tracking various
versions of the project and storing them.

Open Github in a brower and create a repository for your project
Copy the repository URL
In the terminal
    mkdir 'STS project'
    cd 'STS project'
    git init
    touch sts_project.py
    open sts_project.py
        'Enter code for the project in text editor'
    git add .
    git commit -m 'Commit message'
    git remote add origin 'Github repository URL'
    git push origin main
    Enter Github username
    Enter Github password or access token
